## A template landing page for a jewelry company

This project is a template landing page I coded utilizing the following skills:

-HTML
-CSS
-SCSS

In this project, I also implemented my knowledge and learning on media queries, exercising my understanding of resposive design by designing the landing page to be comfortably viewed on different pixel widths.

The layout is uses both a mixture of flex and grid display attributes.

In addition I also had rendered and planned out, how I would layout my landing page In Figma before coding it. It was good practice of using a editing tool to practice designing rendering and editing the layout before producing a carbon copy of it.
