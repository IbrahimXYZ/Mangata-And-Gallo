## A template landing page for a jewelry company

This project is a template landing page I coded utilizing the following skills:

-HTML
-CSS
-SCSS

In this project, I also implemented my knowledge and learning on media queries, exercising my understanding of resposive design by designing the landing page to be comfortably viewed on different pixel widths.

The layout is uses both a mixture of flex and grid display attributes.

In addition I also had rendered and planned out, how I would layout my landing page In Figma before coding it. It was good practice of using a editing tool to practice designing rendering and editing the layout before producing a carbon copy of it.

I enjoyed expressing my creativity in this project, exercising my CSS skills and understanding of UI/UX design which I had pciked up from my study in the META Front End Developer course. It was also my first project using SCSS, and trying to practice the SCSS file strcuture methodology, specifically with a single page website. Using figma to strcuture and plan my construction was also insightful. Picking up the skill of being aple to reproduce designs and renders into a coded produce, I think is alos impactful for my skillset.

What I could improve of this project i think is implementing animations whe scroliing or hovering. Mkae it more aestheically pleasing by exerpiemnting with the contrast, gradients and colors.
